# mission_to_mars

Tools: Python, Pandas, Splinter, BeautifulSoup, MongoDB, PyMongo, Tweepy

Scraping Data From the Web: NASA Mars News, JPL Mars Space Images (Featured Image), Mars Weather, Mars Facts, Mars Hemispheres

In order to plan a mission to Mars, there is a lot of data to scrape and visualize. Using Splinter to visit websites and BeautifulSoup to parse HTML, I scraped the latest news and featured images from NASA, mars facts from space-facts.com, and weather information from Twitter using Tweepy. 

The data is then stored inside MongoDB in the form of dictionaries and then using HTML, I have displayed the information on a webpage.
